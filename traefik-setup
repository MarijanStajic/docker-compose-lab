# .INFORMATION
# For my Traefik setup, I configured an SSL certificate that is not managed with DNS Challenge or the Let's Encrypt method proposed by Traefik by default.
# Let's Encrypt method proposed by Traefik by default. I generated the key and certificate using Certbot. Then, I created a file named "certificat-tls.yaml" where I point to my key. I mounted the volume to avoid using a DNS Challenge if the provider used is not recognized.
# In the configuration below, port 80 is redirected to port 443, which is then verified by an IP allowlist and redirected to the correct port used by the service, using the defined domain name.
